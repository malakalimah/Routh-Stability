# Routh-Stability
This respiratory contains a MATLAB code that includes a main program and RouthCriteria class, this program takes input from user (transfer function) then extract the numerator and denominator polynomials  and apply Routh criteria to examine stability. 
in "routh_proj.mlx" user will give the inputs and run the code lines then "ROuthCriteria.m" class will be called that carries the logic.
Also this analysis carries special cases of routh criteria.
you can expect output to be routh table and a line that tells whether the system is stable or not and the number of real poles also a graph of the system root locus.

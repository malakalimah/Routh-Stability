# Routhâ€“Hurwitz stability criterion
## Over View

This respiratory contains a MATLAB code that includes a main program and RouthCriteria class, this program takes input from user (transfer function) then extract the numerator and denominator polynomials  and apply Routh criteria to examine stability. 
## File Navigation

In "routh_proj.mlx" user will give the inputs and run the code lines then "RouthCriteria.m" class will be called that carries the logic.
Also this analysis carries special cases of routh criteria.

## Main logic

for *i* is row index and *p* is column index of our routh matrix(table)
the new row in matrix of index i+1 will have elements of index (*i+1*,*p*) where index (*i+1*,*p*) carries value equals to values strored in following indecies ( ( (i,p) * (i-1,p+1) ) - ( (i-2,p) * (i,p+1))) / (i,p)



As shown in the code

```
           

           for i=1:itter  %%excute routh criteria
               try
                    for p= 1:y
                        
                           mul1=new_rows((i+1),p);
                           mul2=new_rows((i),(p+1));
                           mul3=new_rows((i),(p));
                           mul4=new_rows((i+1),(p+1));
                           num2=(mul1*mul2)-(mul3*mul4);
                           new = num2/new_rows((i+1),p);
                           append_row(i,p)=new;
                           
                    end
               catch
               append_row(i,p)=0;
               end
```

## Output

You can expect output to be routh table and a line that tells whether the system is stable or not and the number of real poles also a graph of the system root locus.
